# Timmy's Meowtiplying Adventure
Get Timmy home by solving these multiplications! This game was designed for elementary school kids trying to learn their multiplication tables in a fun way!

## Inspiration
Our base inspiration was the game Crossy road. We were mostly inspired by the idea of an animal moving forward in a cartoon style environment. We wanted to make something that is education based but also fun, so we decided to help out younger learners with something we have all had to go through: learning multiplication tables.

## What it does
The user has to solve ten questions regarding multiplication tables that can range from numbers 0 to 12. For each right answer, Timmy advances and gets closer to home. The game also displays a timer. Once the user has completed the game, a message will appear that displays their time. At any point in the game, the user can choose to restart, by pressing the space button, or to go back to the main menu, by pressing the escape button.

## How we built it
We built our project using the Python library called Pygame. This library helped us create the visuals and display our game.

## Here's a video demo of our game :
